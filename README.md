# Math-equations
nestjs code with some mathematical formulas for logic building

# Quadratic formula
Quadratic formula to be applied on:
Eq of the form ax^2+bx+c=0 ,a cannot be zero and must include x^2 term.
First make r.h.s 0 and solve it to l.h.s, if there is any term present.
Then separate the terms by matching the regex and for each term separate co-efficients.
Null value if no real roots exist.

# Integral
indefinite integral for polynomial equations:
Accept polynomial eq and separate the terms by matching the regex. 
For each term get exponent and apply powerRule accordingly. 
Handle constant term and concatenate the resulting equation.

# Standard daviation
accept data set and find mean of the dataset first.
Then find the variance according to the formula and finally returns standard daviation

# Matrix Inversion
accepts 2x2 matrix.. 
Finds the determinant and then inverse of given matrix.
Accepts 3X3 matrix.
First find the determinent.
Then find the adjoint to construct adjecency matrix.
Return the inverse matrix
