# Math-equations
nestjs code with some mathematical formulas for logic building

# Quadratic formula
quadratic formula to be applied on:
eq of the form ax^2+bx+c=0 ,a cannot be zero and must include x^2 term
first make r.h.s 0 and solve it to l.h.s, if there is any term present
Then separate the terms by matching the regex and for each term separate co-efficients
Null value if no real roots exist

# Integral
indefinite integral for polynomial equations:
accept polynomial eq and separate the terms by matching the regex 
for each term get exponent and apply powerRule accordingly 
handle constant term and concatenate the resulting equation

# Standard daviation
accept data set and find mean of the dataset first
then find the variance according to the formula and finally returns standard daviation

# Matrix Inversion
accepts 2x2 matrix 
finds the determinant and then inverse of given matrix
accepts 3X3 matrix
first find the determinent
Then find the adjoint to construct adjecency matrix
return the inverse matrix
